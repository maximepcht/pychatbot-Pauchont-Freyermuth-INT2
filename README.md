To use this program, you should modify only two things:
    input_speeches_folder = (you should replace by the emplacement of your folder speeches)
    output_speeches_folder = (you should replace by the emplacement of your folder cleaned)

For example, mine looks like that:
    input_speeches_folder = (r"C:\Users\maxim\OneDrive - Efrei\L1\2023-2024\Informatics\Python\Projet\Python_Project_Maxime&Ylan\speeches")
    output_speeches_folder = (r"C:\Users\maxim\OneDrive - Efrei\L1\2023-2024\Informatics\Python\Projet\Python_Project_Maxime&Ylan\cleaned")
